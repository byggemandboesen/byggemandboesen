I'm an Earth and Space Physics and Engineering student (as of September 2021) at DTU space🚀 <br>
I'm primarily a self taught programmer since mid high school, however, I took a class of beginner C# insecond year of high school, although I've switched to using python in most cases🐍 <br>

Skills: Python (matplotlib and data processing primarily📊), slight C# and Flutter knowledge
